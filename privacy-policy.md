Privacy Policy for Quick SOP – Work Instructions & SOP Maker
Last updated: 29/11/2025
Quick SOP (“the App”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.
________________________________________
1. Information Collection and Use
1.1 No account, no registration
The App does not require you to create an account or provide your name, email address, or other personal profile details in order to use its core features.
1.2 Documents and content you create
The App is designed for creating SOPs and work instructions. This may include:
•	Text (titles, steps, notes, descriptions)
•	Photos or images you add to your documents
By default:
•	All documents and images you create or attach inside the App are stored locally on your device.
•	This content is not uploaded to our own servers by the App.
You are responsible for how you share or export these documents (e.g. via PDF export, email, messaging apps, cloud storage, etc.).
________________________________________
2. Translations (if you use translation features)
If you use the App’s document translation features, the text of your document (and associated metadata necessary for translation) may be sent to a third-party translation service such as Microsoft Azure Translator in order to perform the translation.
•	The text is transmitted securely to the translation provider solely for the purpose of generating a translation.
•	We do not use this content to personally identify you.
•	We do not sell or share your content with advertisers.
However, the third-party provider may process or store data in accordance with its own privacy policy. You should review the privacy policy of the translation provider for more details.
If you do not use translation features, your document text is not sent to any translation service.
________________________________________
3. In-App Purchases and Payments
The App may offer in-app purchases (for example, unlocking features or buying translations). Payments are processed by:
•	Apple App Store / Apple In-App Purchases, and
•	A third-party purchase management service (such as RevenueCat) that helps manage entitlements and receipts.
We do not receive or store your full payment information (such as credit card numbers). That information is handled by Apple and their payment processors.
These services may collect certain technical data (such as anonymized device identifiers, receipts, purchase history for this app) in order to validate purchases and manage your access to paid features. Their use of data is governed by their own privacy policies.
________________________________________
4. Analytics, Advertising, and Tracking
•	The App does not include third-party advertising SDKs.
•	The App does not sell or share your personal data with advertisers.
Standard app store platforms (such as Apple) may collect their own diagnostic, performance, or usage data as part of the operating system or store environment. This is controlled by your device and store settings, not by the App.
________________________________________
5. Permissions
The App may request access to the following, depending on how you use it:
•	Photos / Media / Library – to allow you to attach images to your SOPs and work instructions, and to export or save generated PDFs or images.
•	Camera – if you choose to take photos directly inside the App to attach to a document.
•	Microphone / Speech Recognition – if the App offers voice-to-text features so you can dictate steps instead of typing.
These permissions are used only to enable the corresponding feature within the App.
Your photos, camera feed, or audio are not uploaded to our own servers by default.
You can manage these permissions at any time in your device settings.
________________________________________
6. Children’s Privacy
The App is designed for workplace and business use and is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us and we will take steps to delete that information where appropriate.
________________________________________
7. Data Security
Because your documents and images are stored locally on your device (unless you choose to share or store them elsewhere), access to them is primarily protected by your device’s own security (such as passcode, Face ID, Touch ID).
We recommend:
•	Using a secure device passcode or biometric lock
•	Keeping your device software up to date
•	Being careful when exporting or sharing documents externally
For any data transmitted to third-party services (such as translations or purchase validation), we use secure connections where supported.
________________________________________
8. Data Retention
•	Documents, SOPs, and photos you create in the App remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App.
•	Any content you have shared externally (e.g. PDFs in email or cloud storage) will remain in those locations according to their policies, not ours.
•	Any data held by third-party services (such as translation providers or purchase management services) is retained according to their own policies.
________________________________________
9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App’s features, services, or legal requirements.
When we make changes:
•	The updated policy will be made available in the same place as this document.
•	The “Last updated” date at the top will be changed.
We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how your information is handled.
